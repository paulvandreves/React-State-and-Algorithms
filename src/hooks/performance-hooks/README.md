Performance Hooks: https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks#performance-hooks

A common way to optimize re-rendering performance is to skip unnecessary work. For example, you can tell React to reuse a cached calculation or to skip a re-render if the data has not changed since the previous render.

To skip calculations and unnecessary re-rendering, use one of these Hooks:

useMemo lets you cache the result of an expensive calculation.
useCallback lets you cache a function definition before passing it down to an optimized component.
function TodoList({ todos, tab, theme }) {
  const visibleTodos = useMemo(() => filterTodos(todos, tab), [todos, tab]);
  // ...
}
Sometimes, you can’t skip re-rendering because the screen actually needs to update. In that case, you can improve performance by separating blocking updates that must be synchronous (like typing into an input) from non-blocking updates which don’t need to block the user interface (like updating a chart).

To prioritize rendering, use one of these Hooks:

useTransition lets you mark a state transition as non-blocking and allow other updates to interrupt it.
useDeferredValue lets you defer updating a non-critical part of the UI and let other parts update first.
