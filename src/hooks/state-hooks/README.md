State Hooks: https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks#state-hooks

State lets a component “remember” information like user input. For example, a form component can use state to store the input value, while an image gallery component can use state to store the selected image index.
To add state to a component, use one of these Hooks:

useState declares a state variable that you can update directly.
useReducer declares a state variable with the update logic inside a reducer function.
